FPU
===

FPU is the result of the final simulation project project for the Computational Physics course I took in 2009. The [Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Pasta%E2%80%93Ulam_problem) was proposed by Fermi while working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The resulting simulation was one of the very first Molecular Dynamics simulations in the history of science.

This is a very simple reproduction of the same simulation.
